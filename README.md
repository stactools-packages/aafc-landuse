## Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Land Use

### Description

The Land Use (LU) maps cover all areas of Canada south of 600N at a spatial resolution of 30 metres. The LU classes follow the protocol of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and consist of: Forest, Water, Cropland, Grassland, Settlement and Otherland.

The Land Use (LU) maps were developed in response to a need for explicit, high-accuracy, high-resolution land use data to meet AAFCâ€™s commitments in international reporting, especially for the annual National Inventory Report (NIR) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Agri-Environmental program of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the FAOSTAT component of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
