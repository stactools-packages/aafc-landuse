## Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Land Use

### Description

The Land Use (LU) maps cover all areas of Canada south of 60&deg;N at a spatial resolution of 30 metres. The LU classes follow the protocol of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and consist of: Forest, Water, Cropland, Grassland, Settlement and Otherland.

The Land Use (LU) maps were developed in response to a need for explicit, high-accuracy, high-resolution land use data to meet AAFCâ€™s commitments in international reporting, especially for the annual National Inventory Report (NIR) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Agri-Environmental program of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the FAOSTAT component of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

### Usage

```bash
# Create a STAC Collection
stac aafclanduse create-collection "/path/to/directory"
# The file /path/to/directory/aafc_landuse_collection.json is created

# Create a COG - this can be done using remote or local .tif or .zip assets
stac aafclanduse create-cog "/path/to/directory/IMG_AAFC_LANDUSE_Z07_2010.tif" "/path/to/directory"
# The file /path/to/directory/IMG_AAFC_LANDUSE_Z07_2010_cog.tif is created

# Create a STAC Item from the above COG
stac aafclanduse create-item /path/to/directory /path/to/directoryIMG_AAFC_LANDUSE_Z07_2010_cog.tif
# The file /path/to/directory/IMG_AAFC_LANDUSE_Z07_2010_cog.json is created
